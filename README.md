# Moonridge-client
client library for Mongo remote ORM framework [Moonridge](https://github.com/capaj/Moonridge).

Install with jspm(for browser) or npm(for node):

```
npm install moonridge-client

jspm install moonridge-client
``` 
###Browser prerequisities

Moonridge is written in commonJS format(client works in node and browser without much hassle), so you need globally installed [jspm](https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli) to be able to install it. For running, you need [systemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs)(which JSPM installs for you).
If you don't have jspm, install it with this command:

    npm i jspm -g
